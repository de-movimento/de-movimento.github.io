      <p>Portugal is a small country that, as far as possible, tries to cover all areas within the scope of culture. Analyzing the past and the results presented in the development of cultural transmitters helps us to give more importance to our culture.</p>
      <p>Deep down, it is important to be partial and fair, so that we can take root and build the future.</p>
      <p>
        The present text presents an unfortunate case, not only to express dissatisfaction with a particular case, but also with the intention of appealing for improvement, to prevent a nepotic system from repressing our culture. This text aims to clarify some idiosyncrasies of a
        very specific group in the arts and therefore necessarily elitist.
      </p>
      <p>In times of precariousness and economic instability in our society, problems and needs are especially aggravated within the area of culture and are easily overlooked.</p>
      <p>The case presented deserves attention as an example to be avoided so that there is an improvement in the situation of the arts and culture in Portugal, by showing that the current regulation is lame, questioning its gaps so that they can be filled in the future.</p>
      <p>
        I am a Portuguese citizen and sound artist. I carried out my studies outside Portugal and my pieces have with difficulty been shown abroad over the last few years at conferences and at relevant art and research centers in the field of sound art/acousmatic music. So far, I
        have never had support from my country or any entity.
      </p>
      <p>I only had one piece presented in my city, Lisbon, in one of the oldest associations in this area in Portugal.</p>
      <p>
        The association in question is Miso Music, which has 400,000 euros a year on a four-year basis. Every year, this association repeats the same formula, always being guaranteed continuity and financial support. From operas to theatre, they do everything and, as a rule, it's
        just two people managing it. Until a few years ago, the association was just the couple that founded it.
      </p>
      <p>It is totally autonomous and ends up deciding who it supports and what conditions it supports.</p>
      <p>The founding members carry out their own productions in-house. They annually organize festivals with artists from the area from different parts of the world. It has its own equipment of the highest quality that it has acquired over the years.</p>
      <p>These festivals bring names of high international standing to the country where some people from this niche attend. The number of audiences has always been extremely low, which can be seen because they are shows for a very specific audience.</p>
      <p>
        I would like to report an experience that unfortunately seems to have almost surreal contours. In order to create a musical piece as part of an artistic residency, I contacted the aforementioned association. A short dialogue began, I was asked about the material I would
        need and, after a simple explanation on my part, I was never contacted again.
      </p>
      <p>The musical piece ended up being created only with my means and, surreally, it was exhibited at the Música Viva Festival organized by the organization as having been created in an artist residency.</p>
      <p>A year later, it was shown again at a festival in Germany, which made me once again ask for financial support, this time to present it. The response of one of the founding members was «(...)It is very complicated, only for important people with a lot of name».</p>

        <div>
          <p>Very complicated? We will see.</p>
          <p>This association has most of its funds coming from the state through government entities, which are renewed every year, as you can read on the website, in a pdf document.</p>
          <p>
            Currently, it is awarded the sum of 400 thousand euros per year, for a period of four years, for having a special status (1.6 million until 2026). In this document of the support granted, one can read the request for support to the DGA (General Directorate of Arts) by
            transversal associations.
          </p>
          <p>
            By transversal associations, I mean those that have a common founding member. Namely, Sond'Ar-te Electric Ensemble, Miso Music Research & Information Center. In recent years, all have had some form of support from the DGA several times. One of the members of this
            association is the main element in all of them. These associations have existed for some years and apparently represent part of the culture's vision for music in our country.
          </p>
          <p>The founding couple exchange roles, creating a paradigm in which one simply sees, between them, the constant change of titles such as composer, sound designer, founder, artistic director. Just see your own productions declared by the site.</p>
          <p>
            This unruly behavior actually reflects the mindset that is a result of mismanagement by the government entity. The association does not need to make changes to its objectives on a large scale, due to the ease of obtaining support and the continuity confirmed by the
            regulatory body, the DGA. The publicly available file in pdf to analyzes the candidacies and decides on the fate and continuity of support by the DGA for the association in question.

      <p>The DGA and its report, in poor and almost indecipherable Portuguese.</p>
      <p>So let's try to decipher it, while artificial intelligence does not reach the bureaucratic department of government bodies.</p>
      <p>Everything is available at the following links for consultation: I decided to emphasize the most important aspects</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dgartes.gov.pt/sites/default/files/apoiosustentado_musica_e_opera_ata11_anexo01.pdf">Link to decision minute/proceeding (only available in Portuguese) </a> - Annex I - Page-19/20:</p>

      <p>Report summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>criterion a): «The application presents activities without a timetable and/or budget and others that are repeated, causing confusion and difficulty in reading, which contribute to the activity appearing to be much broader than it actually is.»</li>
        <li>Criterion a) is called the activity plan. The DGA awarded it 17.5 out of 20 even admitting it's poorly made.</li>
        <li>
          criterion b): «As all the elements participating in the application are not known, it is not possible to assess suitability, professional and artistic experience in its entirety. Thus, this Committee considers that the score awarded in this criterion, 16.5 points out of
          20»
        </li>
        <li>Entity and teams . The DGA, given the lack of knowledge of the team members, assigns 16.5 out of 20.</li>
        <li>criterion e) «It should be noted that even if a part of the communication is in charge of third parties, this does not invalidate its presentation in the application. On the contrary, it would have been an added value for the application assessment process.»</li>
        <li>The association may use contributor funds to contract outside services. This concrete information is not available anywhere or in any report. It seems to me that there is no transparency with taxpayers' money, and this fact is serious.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Being fair and partial is difficult when determining which associations are entitled to conserve and emancipate a strand of art through national culture with citizens' money. I believe that change is built without haste to be consistent and solid. However, change is
        necessary and fundamental in cases where the final result is negative. Miso Music is an example of this. If the result is always the same, year after year it becomes restrictive. Development is stalled.
